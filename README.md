# My Programming Journey - Dart Basics & Git Workflow

This repository represents my very first steps in the world of software development. I created this space to learn the fundamentals of programming from scratch, using the **Dart language** as my starting point.

## Learning Objectives

### 1. Version Control with Git
Beyond writing code, this repository served as my training ground for professional developer tools.
* **Commit History**: I practiced the habit of regular committing to document my progress and understand how version control works.
* **Workflow**: I learned how to manage files, handle basic Git operations, and maintain a structured repository.

### 2. Programming Fundamentals
I solved numerous tasks and exercises to master the core logic of programming.
* **Basics**: Implementation of variables, operators, and standard input/output operations.
* **Problem Solving**: Exercises involving string manipulation (e.g., reversing words), working with objects, and basic conditional logic.

### 3. Transition to Advanced Concepts
As I grew more comfortable with the basics, I moved on to more complex Computer Science topics:
* **Data Structures**: I manually implemented linked lists, stacks, queues, and hash tables to understand how data is organized in memory.
* **Design Patterns**: I explored software architecture by implementing patterns like **Singleton**, **Decorator**, and **Factory**.
