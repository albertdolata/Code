# #100DaysOfCode Challenge - Learning Dart

This repository documents my very first steps in software development, built during the **#100DaysOfCode challenge**. I used this space to learn the fundamentals of programming from scratch.



## Learning Goals & Consistency

### 1. Version Control & Git Discipline
The primary focus of this challenge was to master professional developer tools through daily practice.
* **Daily Commits**: I focused on making regular commits to document my progress and learn the nuances of Git version control.
* **Transparent Workflow**: By participating in the challenge, I learned how to structure a repository and maintain a clear history of changes.

### 2. From Syntax to Logic (Dart)
I started with zero programming knowledge and progressively tackled more complex problems.
* **The Basics**: Mastering variables, operators, and I/O operations through small daily tasks.
* **Problem Solving**: Solving exercises like string manipulation (e.g., word reversal) and logical tasks to build algorithmic thinking.

### 3. Advanced Concepts
As the challenge progressed, I moved from basic scripts to implementing advanced Computer Science concepts:
* **Data Structures**: Manual implementation of Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and Hash Tables to understand memory organization.
* **Design Patterns**: Practical exercises in software architecture, including **Singleton**, **Decorator**, and **Factory** patterns.
